        Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Thursday that China will unswervingly support the development of the country's private sector, and will continue to strengthen the public sector amid concerns over the development of private enterprise in China.
        "We will create a sound legal environment and further improve the business environment for private companies," Xi said during a visit to China Zhongwang Holdings Limited in Northeast China's Liaoning Province on Thursday.
        Xi pointed out that many of the country's reform efforts are aimed at further developing the private economy and urged private companies to have confidence.
        "We will unswervingly develop the public sector and will unswervingly encourage, support, guide and protect the development of the private sector," Xi said.
        "The Communist Party of China's policies are favorable to the development of private companies," Xi said. "Private enterprise owners should also spare no efforts in developing more first-rate products."
        The president's comments come at a time when a debate on the relationship between the country's State-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private firms continues to gain traction among the public, leading to rising concerns over the fate of China's private sector.
